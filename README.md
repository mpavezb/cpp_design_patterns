# udemy_cpp_design_patterns

Code for the Design Patterns in Modern C++ course from Udemy.

## Overview

Design patterns are common architectural approaches. They were popularized by the Gang of Four book (1994) for Smalltalk and C++.

## Gamma Categorization

Design Patterns are tipically split into three categories. This is called *Gamma Categorization* after Erich Gamma, one of the GoF authors.

### Creational Patterns

- Deal with the creation of objects.
- Explicit vs. Implicit: Constructor vs. [Dependency Injection, reflection, ...].
- Wholesale vs. piecewise initialization.

### Structural Patterns

- Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members).
- Many patterns are wrapers that mimic the underlying class interface.
- Stress the importance of godd API design. **Make API usable for other people**.

### Behavioral Patterns

- They are all different; no central theme.
- They solve particular problems.

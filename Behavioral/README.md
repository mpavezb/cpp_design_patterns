## Chain of Responsibility

**A chain of components who all get a change to process a command, optionally having default implementations and the ability to stop the processing chain.**

Example: GUI processing of user input: Button -> Button Container -> Window frame -> Window -> Desktop. 

### Code Samples

**pointer_chain**: Linked List of commands. Each component of the chain works on the object and gives it to the next one, possibly breaking the chain. This is how this pattern used to be implemented in the past.

**signal_chain**: Observer pattern is used to signal components who can participate in the chain.

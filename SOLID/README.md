# SOLID Design Principles

Useful principles of Obejct Oriented Design. These were introduced by Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin).


## STUPID vs SOLID

|     |                        |
|:---:|:-----------------------|
|  S  | Singleton              |
|  T  | Tight Coupling         |
|  U  | Untestability          |
|  P  | Premature Optimization |
|  I  | Indescriptive Naming   |
|  D  | Duplication            |

|     |                     |
|:---:|:--------------------|
|  S  |Single Responsibility|
|  O  |Open-close           |
|  L  |Liskov substitution  |
|  I  |Interface segregation|
|  D  |Dependency inversion |


## Single Responsibility

A class should have a single reason to change. - **Separation of Concerns** 

## Open-Closed

The system should be **open to extension and closed to modification**.

- We want to avoid modifying code that already works.
- Extension can be done by inheritance.

## Liskov Substitution

Subtypes should be inmediatly substitutable by their base types.

- Methods designed to work on the Base class should keep working
  when a Derived instance is used.
- Named after Robert Liskov.

## Interface Segregation

Avoid putting too much into a single interface. Don't force
implementers to code too large interfaces.

- Partial implementers contain dummy methods and extra code.
- Partial implementers give a wrong API to the user.

## Dependency Inversion

1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

Prefer depending on abstractions (abstract and interfaces) rather than specific classes. *Avoid depending on the implementation details*.

# SOLID Design Principles

Useful principles of Obejct Oriented Design. These were introduced by Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin).

## Single Responsibility

A class should have a single reason to change. - **Separation of Concerns** 

## Open-Closed

The system should be **open to extension and closed to modification**.

- We want to avoid modifying code that already works.
- Extension can be done by inheritance.

## Liskov Substitution

Subtypes should be inmediatly substitutable by their base types.

- Methods designed to work on the Base class should keep working
  when a Derived instance is used.
- Named after Robert Liskov.

## Interface Segregation

Avoid putting too much into a single interface. Don't force
implementers to code too large interfaces.

- Partial implementers contain dummy methods and extra code.
- Partial implementers give a wrong API to the user.

## Dependency Inversion

A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

- Prefer depending on abstractions (abstract and interfaces) rather than specific classes. *Avoid depending on the implementation details*.

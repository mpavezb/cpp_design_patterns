### Open-Closed Principle

The system should be open to extension and closed to modification.

- We want to avoid modifying code that already works.
- Extension can be done by inheritance.

Subtypes should be inmediatly substitutable by their base types.
- Methods designed to work on the Base class should keep working
  when a Derived instance is used.

## Builder

**The builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step.**

*Rationale*: Simple objects can be created in single constructor call, but complex objects require a lot of ceremony. We dont want a constructor with 10 arguments, so we use a piecewise construction.

Instead of building the object from scratch, the builder creates object oriented structures that represent each element involved.
